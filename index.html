<h1> selamat datang </h1>

<p align = "justify"> My name is Felicia Natalie Wijaya. I'm an Indoensian fresh graduate from George Mason University, majoring in Computational and Data Sciences with minor in Data Analysis. I built this Github Page while waiting for interviews under the pretense of being highly productive during the pandemic. </p>

<p align = "justify"> The site contains snippets of my <i>pièce de résistance</i> starting from my junior year in college. The purpose of posting them up, aside as a portofolio, is to create a learning place. The contents that I posted hopefully will benefit someone out there as a reference or spark a discussion on efficient coding and whatnot. </p>

<p align = "justify"> In my free time I like to indulge in a few hobbies like Origami and coffee hopping, the latter before the pandemic started. Nowadays, I watch YouTube videos on Asian streetfood and cook healthy meals on a regular basis. </p>
