My name is Felicia Natalie Wijaya. I'm an Indoensian fresh graduate from George Mason University, majoring in Computational and Data Sciences with minor in Data Analysis. I built this Github Page while waiting for interviews under the pretense of being highly productive during the pandemic.

The site contains links to my <i>pièce de résistance</i> starting from my junior year in college. The purpose of posting them up, aside acting as a portofolio, is to create a learning place. The contents that I posted hopefully will benefit someone out there as a reference or spark a discussion on efficient coding and whatnot.

In my free time I like to indulge in a few hobbies like Origami and coffee hopping, the latter before the pandemic started. Nowadays, I watch YouTube videos on Asian streetfood and cook healthy meals on a regular basis while maintaining a healthier lifestyle for the body and mind.

### [data-interview-qs](https://project-dmaestro.github.io/data-interview-qs/)

I attempt to explain and come up with a solution for [Data Interview Qs](https://www.interviewqs.com/) challenges using R, Python and SQL. The question covers both data science and basic programming competencies that's usually asked during tech interviews. The skills in questions are database querying, statistics, machine learning, simulation, data analysis, data visualization, data manipulation and data structure. I'm open for discussion to a plethora of different answers to improve my understanding and coding ability ~~because detailed solutions in Python require subscription.~~
