# hello

<p> My name is Felicia Natalie Wijaya. I'm an Indoensian fresh graduate from George Mason University, majoring in Computational and Data Sciences with minor in Data Analysis. I built this Github Page while waiting for interviews under the pretense of being highly productive during the pandemic. </p>

<p> The page contains snippets of my _pièce de résistance_ starting from my junior year in college. The purpose of posting them up, aside as a portofolio, is to create a learning place. The contents that I posted hopefully will benefit someone out there or spark a discussion on efficient coding and whatnot. </p>
